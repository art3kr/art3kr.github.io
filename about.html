My name is Antonio Trani and I am an engineer and data scientist living in Washington, D.C.  I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2017 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering.  You can find my professional resume on this site.  I speak English and Spanish and enjoy traveling, chess, biking and learning new things.  The picture above was taken at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.
